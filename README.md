### How Bot works:
First, i would like to say that this is a simple bot and is not my focus right now, but was a opportunity to work with Python language in a harder level than i used to. Althought, i could understand about apis and how it works, also knew a bit of database, and i believe that this is important for my growth in Data Science carrer.
